Vulnversity is the second room in the Offensive Pentesting. It is designed to hepl you learn how to scan and access machines, end with you doing privilege escalation.
## Task 1 -- Deploy the Machine

The first step is to turn on the machine\
![Task1]({{ '/assets/task1.jpg' | relative_url }})

Dont forget to turn on OpenVp `openvpn VpnFile.opvn`


## Task 2 -- Reconnaissance
Task 2 require you to use nmap to scan the attack machines IP. nmap is a free, open-source network scanner. Using the -sV, which tries to determine the services running and what versions they are.
Using the command `nmap -sV IP_Address` and allowing it time to run, you should get\
![Task2]({{ '/assets/task2.jpg' | relative_url }})

    Scan the box, how many ports are open? 6 <br>
    What version of the squid proxy is running on the machine? 3.5.12<br>
    How many ports will nmap scan if the flag -p-400 was used? 400<br>
    Using the nmap flag -n what will it not resolve? DNS<br>
    What is the most likely operating system this machine is running? Ubuntu<br>
    What port is the web server running on? 3333<br>

## Task 3 -- Using GoBuster to locate directories
Gobuster is an free, open-source tool that brute-forces URI's to find the directories and files on website.
You will first need to install gobuster. If you are on kali 2020.1, install by running `sudo apt-get install gobuster`
If you are on another OS, you will need to follow the link and installing from the github [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

After that has installed, you will need to locate the world list. On kali use `cd /usr/share/worldlists`, I went into the `dirbuster` directory and picked `directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
Next, I ran `gobuster dir -u http://IP_address:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
This is a good time to stand-up and get some water, it will take some time.<br>

After some time, you will see a few options show up
![Task3]({{ '/assets/task3.jpg' | relative_url }})
It might be useful to see if any of these are what we are looking for<br>
`http://IP_Address:3333/`

    What is the directory that has an upload form page? /internal/
</details>

## Task 4 -- Compromising the webserver
Now that we have our upload form, we need to compromise it by uploading a file, but it seems that some file extenions are blocked.
<details>
    <summary>Click To See The Anwers</summary>
    what common extension seems to be blocked? .php
</details>

To find out which extions are blocked we can fuzzing. There are two ways to do this.
<details>
    <summary>Method 1: BurpSuite</summary>
    To use burp, we first need to launch it, I just use the present untill I get to this page
    ![Task4]({{ '/assets/task4.jpg' | relative_url }})
    At the top, click on the proxy tab and make sure Intercept is on
    ![Task4.1]({{ '/assets/task4.1.jpg' | relative_url }})
    Next we need to configure our browser to use burp's proxy, in Firefox click the 3 line in the top right and mouse down to <em>Preferences</em>, in the prefernce menu search bar type in <em>Proxy</em>, and click the online option. Burp's proxy address is <code>127.0.0.1</code>. You will need to type that in under the manual proxy config option
    ![Task4.2]({{ '/assets/task4.2.jpg' | relative_url }})
    Then click OK.
    Now go back to the upload form page again. <code>http://IP_Address:3333/internal/</code>
    You will notice that it will not load, that is normal. Burp has captured the request and it waiting for you. Go back to burp and click on the foward button. You should now see the upload form page.<br>
    We need to make our attack list, make a text document containing these extensions
    <ul>
    <li>.php</li>
    <li>.php3</li>
    <li>.php4</li>
    <li>.php5</li>
    <li>.phtml</li>
    </ul>

## Task 5 -- Privilege Escaltion
