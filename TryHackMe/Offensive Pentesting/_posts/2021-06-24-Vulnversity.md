Vulnversity is the second room in the Offensive Pentesting. It is designed to hepl you learn how to scan and access machines, end with you doing privilege escalation.
## Task 1 -- Deploy the Machine

The first step is to turn on the machine\
![Task1]({{ '/assets/task1.jpg' | relative_url }})

Dont forget to turn on OpenVp `openvpn VpnFile.opvn`


## Task 2 -- Reconnaissance
Task 2 require you to use nmap to scan the attack machines IP. nmap is a free, open-source network scanner. Using the -sV, which tries to determine the services running and what versions they are.
Using the command `nmap -sV IP_Address` and allowing it time to run, you should get\
![Task2]({{ '/assets/task2.jpg' | relative_url }})

## Task 3 -- Using GoBuster to locate directories
Gobuster is an free, open-source tool that brute-forces URI's to find the directories and files on website.
You will first need to install gobuster. If you are on kali 2020.1, install by running `sudo apt-get install gobuster`
If you are on another OS, you will need to follow the link and installing from the github [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

After that has installed, you will need to locate the world list. On kali use `cd /usr/share/worldlists`, I went into the `dirbuster` directory and picked `directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
Next, I ran `gobuster dir -u http://IP_address:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
This is a good time to stand-up and get some water, it will take some time.<br>

After some time, you will see a few options show up
![Task3]({{ '/assets/task3.jpg' | relative_url }})
It might be useful to see if any of these are what we are looking for<br>
`http://IP_Address:3333/`
