Vulnversity is the second room in the Offensive Pentesting. It is designed to hepl you learn how to scan and access machines, end with you doing privilege escalation.
## Task 1 -- Deploying the Machine

The first step is to turn on the machine\
![Task1]({{ '/assets/task1.jpg' | relative_url }})

Dont forget to turn on OpenVp `openvpn VpnFile.opvn`


## Task 2 -- Reconnaissance
Task 2 require you to use nmap to scan the attack machines IP. nmap is a free, open-source network scanner. Using the -sV, which tries to determine the services running and what versions they are.
Using the command `nmap -sV IP_Address` and allowing it time to run, you should get\
![Task2]({{ '/assets/task2.jpg' | relative_url }})

    Scan the box, how many ports are open? 6 <br>
    What version of the squid proxy is running on the machine? 3.5.12<br>
    How many ports will nmap scan if the flag -p-400 was used? 400<br>
    Using the nmap flag -n what will it not resolve? DNS<br>
    What is the most likely operating system this machine is running? Ubuntu<br>
    What port is the web server running on? 3333<br>
</details>

## Task 3 -- Using GoBuster to locate directories
Gobuster is an free, open-source tool that brute-forces URI's to find the directories and files on website.
You will first need to install gobuster. If you are on kali 2020.1, install by running `sudo apt-get install gobuster`
If you are on another OS, you will need to follow the link and installing from the github [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

After that has installed, you will need to locate the world list. On kali use `cd /usr/share/worldlists`, I went into the `dirbuster` directory and picked `directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
Next, I ran `gobuster dir -u http://IP_address:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`<br>
This is a good time to stand-up and get some water, it will take some time.<br>

After some time, you will see a few options show up
![Task3]({{ '/assets/task3.jpg' | relative_url }})
It might be useful to see if any of these are what we are looking for<br>
`http://IP_Address:3333/`

    What is the directory that has an upload form page? /internal/

## Task 4 -- Compromising the webserver
Now that we have our upload form, we need to compromise it by uploading a file, but it seems that some file extenions are blocked.
<details>
    <summary>Click To See The Anwers</summary>
    what common extension seems to be blocked? .php
</details>

To find out which extions are blocked, I used burpsuit.<br>
To use burp, we first need to launch it, I just use the present untill I get to this page
    <img src="/assets/task4.jpg" alt="Task4"><br>
    At the top, click on the proxy tab and make sure Intercept is on
    <img src="/assets/task4.1.jpg" alt="Task4.1"><br>
    Next we need to configure our browser to use burp's proxy, in Firefox click the 3 line in the top right and mouse down to <em>Preferences</em>, in the prefernce menu search bar type in <em>Proxy</em>, and click the online option. Burp's proxy address is <code>127.0.0.1</code>. You will need to type that in under the manual proxy config option.
    <img src="/assets/task4.2.jpg" alt="Task4.2"><br>
    Then click OK.
    Now go back to the upload form page again. <code>http://IP_Address:3333/internal/</code>.<br>
    You will notice that it will not load, that is normal. Burp has captured the request and it waiting for you. Go back to burp and click on the foward button. You should now see the upload form page.<br>
    Now we need to make our attack list, make a text document, it can be named anything, I chose <code>phptext.txt</code>, containing these extensions
    <ul>
    <li>.php</li>
    <li>.php3</li>
    <li>.php4</li>
    <li>.php5</li>
    <li>.phtml</li>
    </ul>
    Now that we have that, we need to click on the <em>Intruder</em> option, it should be right next to <em>Proxy</em>. Under <em>Payload</em> click <em>Load ...</em> and load the phptext.txt that we created earlier.<br>
    For the attack to work correctly we need to first capture and upload. Make sure that your browser is on the upload form page. Next click on the <em>Submit</em> button and you should see this appear in burp.
    <img src="/assets/task4.3.jpg" alt="Task 4.3"><br>
    Now we send it to <em>Intruder</em>, we can either use <code>Ctrl+I</code>, or the <em>Action</em> button and then <em>Send to Intruder</em>.<br>
    Next we need to update the filename line to look like this. Click the Clear option on the side, then type <code>shell.php</code> after the filename=<br>
    Next highlight the .php you just added and click on the add button on the side.
    It should look like this.
    <img src="assets/task4.4.jpg" alt="Task 4.4"><br>
    Make sure you go to <em>Payloads</em>, and at the very bottom turn off encoding. It will not work otherwise.<br>
    Next go to options andd down to Grep - Match and turn it on. Next click clear, and then add <code>Extension Not Allowed</code>. It should look like this.<br>
    <img src="/assets/task4.5.jpg" alt="Task 4.5"><br>
    Now click Start Attack!

## Task 5 -- Privilege Escaltion
